Stage 2 Assignment- Fill in the blank

This is just an assignment that I've been working on for stage 2 in Udacity's intro to coding class. 

I know there must be a much much better way of doing it, I just got frusterated and this came out. 

This is what they are going to grade on it:

Use of Variables: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable names should reflect the values they store.
Functions: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.
Appropriate use of Data: Data types (strings vs lists for example) should be used appropriately.
Appropriate use of other coding techniques: Your code should use statements like if, then, else, while, etc... appropriately.
Each function includes a comment: Comments explain function behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable.)
The rubric that will be used is included below:
